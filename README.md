# obisidian playground plugin
this is a playground plugin to showcase plugins capabilities

to run and develop the plugins:
1. enable hot reload plugin
2. go to .obsidian/plugins/<plugin name>/
3. run "npm install" to get package.json depdencies
4. run "npm run dev" so every change in the typescript file automatically generate the .js file

few notes:
1. data.json file is for the plugin settings object
2. some of the files here are for vscode configuration
